# Code-Parser
This scanner reads files from a directory called Input and converts it to tokens. The output is a color-coded HTML file in the Output directory. The repository includes single-thread and multi-threaded versions and a runtime comparison between them.

Running instructions:

Replace the directory path string in the files *parSynt.java* and *seqSynt.java* which says:
*C:\\Users\\oscar\\Documentos\\IMC_Proyecto\\*
With your local directory path.
After doing so, compule the java files with: *javac fileName.java* and execute them using the *java className.class* command.
If you want to change the searched regular expressions you can do so by following the instructions in *Scanner/scanner.md*.
